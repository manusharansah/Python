    "5. What problem arises if two independent variables are highly correlated?  \n",
    "6. What is the difference between overfitting and underfitting in regression?  \n",
    "7. How does normalization or scaling of features affect regression models?  \n",
    "8. Suppose you predict CO2 emissions of cars using Weight and Volume. If a car‚Äôs weight doubles, does CO2 always double? Why or why not?  \n",
    "9. What is the purpose of using dummy variables (one-hot encoding) in regression?  \n",
